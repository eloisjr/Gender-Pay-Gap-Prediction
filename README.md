# Gender Pay Gap Prediction using ARIMA Model

Predicting the future trends of the gender pay gap is a crucial step in understanding and addressing workplace inequalities. This project applies the AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model to forecast when the gender pay gap, based on the "average total remuneration GPG," is expected to approach zero, utilizing data from the Workplace Gender Equality Agency (WGEA).

**Overview**

The ARIMA model is a powerful time series analysis tool that considers temporal dependencies and trends in data. By applying this model to historical gender pay gap data from WGEA, I aim to provide insights into the potential timeframe for achieving gender pay equality in the workplace.

**Data Source**

The dataset for this analysis is sourced directly from the WGEA, encompassing historical records of the average total remuneration gender pay gap. This dataset helps to build a predictive model based on real-world workplace trends and initiatives.

Data information was extracted from the "Average Total Remuneration GPG" graph from the WGEA website.

The data presented in the WGEA Data Explorer originates from employer reports submitted annually to WGEA. This dataset reflects the commitment of a diverse range of organizations to advancing gender equality in the workplace. Notably, a significant majority of reporting entities are single employers, contributing to the richness and diversity of the dataset.

**Results and Visualization**

The project provides visualizations illustrating the predicted trajectory of the gender pay gap, leveraging real-world data from WGEA. These insights can be instrumental in informing policies and initiatives aimed at reducing workplace gender inequalities within the context of the Australian workforce.
